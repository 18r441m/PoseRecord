# PoseRecord

## Overview
PoseRecord is a project developed as part of CSCE 774 for the Fall 2023 semester. This repository contains my submission for Assignment 3.

**Note:** This application is currently in an experimental stage and requires further development.

### Application Details
PoseRecord is an Android application that integrates Google's ARCore technology. The application is designed to capture and log various types of data, including:

- **Images**: Captured at a frequency of 30Hz using ARCore.
- **Pose Data**: Obtained from ARCore.
- **Sensor Data**: Includes readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope.

### Script Utilities
The repository includes a script, `run_container`, which facilitates the processing of the collected data. This script executes the `data2bag` Python script inside a Docker container. The primary function of `data2bag` is to convert the data gathered by the Android app into a ROS bag file.

### Data Sets
The data sets generated by PoseRecord are currently private and not publicly accessible. Links and access instructions will be provided when they become available.
